1,Aspirin,Ibuprofen,moderate,Increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and reduced cardioprotective effect of aspirin,Both inhibit COX enzymes and platelet function leading to additive GI effects,Avoid combination or use alternative pain reliever. If needed take aspirin first and wait 30 minutes,high
2,Aspirin,Warfarin,severe,Significantly increased bleeding risk including life-threatening hemorrhage,Additive anticoagulant effects through different mechanisms,Avoid combination unless medically necessary with close INR monitoring,high
3,Aspirin,Clopidogrel,moderate,Increased bleeding risk but may be intentionally combined for cardiac protection,Both inhibit platelet function through different mechanisms,Monitor for signs of bleeding. Combination often intentional post-stent,high
4,Metformin,Lisinopril,low,May enhance blood sugar lowering effect,ACE inhibitors may improve insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake,Monitor blood glucose levels more frequently,moderate
5,Metformin,Contrast Dye,severe,Risk of lactic acidosis especially with kidney impairment,Contrast may cause acute kidney injury impairing metformin clearance,Stop metformin before and 48 hours after contrast procedures,high
6,Lisinopril,Losartan,moderate,Dual RAAS blockade increases risk of hyperkalemia and kidney problems,Both block renin-angiotensin system causing additive effects,Generally avoid combination. Monitor potassium and kidney function if used,high
7,Lisinopril,Potassium Supplements,moderate,Risk of hyperkalemia which can cause cardiac arrhythmias,ACE inhibitors reduce aldosterone and potassium excretion,Monitor potassium levels regularly. Avoid high potassium foods,high
8,Lisinopril,NSAIDs,moderate,Reduced blood pressure control and increased kidney risk,NSAIDs reduce prostaglandins needed for ACE inhibitor action and kidney perfusion,Avoid long-term combination. Monitor blood pressure and kidney function,high
9,Metoprolol,Amlodipine,low,Additive effects on heart rate and blood pressure,Both lower blood pressure and heart rate through different mechanisms,Monitor heart rate and blood pressure. Usually safe combination,moderate
10,Metoprolol,Albuterol,moderate,Reduced effectiveness of both drugs in some patients,Beta-agonist and beta-blocker have opposing effects on beta receptors,Use cardioselective beta-blocker if needed. Monitor asthma control,moderate
11,Atorvastatin,Gemfibrozil,severe,Significantly increased risk of muscle damage and rhabdomyolysis,Gemfibrozil inhibits statin metabolism increasing blood levels,Avoid combination. Use fenofibrate if fibrate needed with statin,high
12,Atorvastatin,Grapefruit,moderate,Increased statin levels and risk of side effects,Grapefruit inhibits CYP3A4 enzyme that metabolizes atorvastatin,Limit grapefruit consumption or use pravastatin or rosuvastatin,moderate
13,Warfarin,Vitamin K,moderate,Reduced anticoagulant effect,Vitamin K is essential for clotting factor synthesis antagonized by warfarin,Maintain consistent vitamin K intake. Monitor INR closely,high
14,Warfarin,Acetaminophen,low,May increase anticoagulant effect with high doses or prolonged use,Acetaminophen may affect vitamin K metabolism at high doses,Limit acetaminophen to less than 2g per day. Monitor INR,moderate
15,Ciprofloxacin,Antacids,moderate,Significantly reduced ciprofloxacin absorption and effectiveness,Metal cations in antacids bind to ciprofloxacin preventing absorption,Take ciprofloxacin 2 hours before or 6 hours after antacids,high
16,Ciprofloxacin,Theophylline,severe,Increased theophylline levels risking toxicity,Ciprofloxacin inhibits theophylline metabolism,Monitor theophylline levels. Consider dose reduction or alternative antibiotic,high
17,Sertraline,MAOIs,severe,Risk of serotonin syndrome which can be life-threatening,Both increase serotonin levels through different mechanisms,Contraindicated. Wait 14 days between stopping MAOI and starting SSRI,high
18,Sertraline,Tramadol,moderate,Increased risk of serotonin syndrome and seizures,Both increase serotonin levels and lower seizure threshold,Use with caution. Monitor for serotonin syndrome symptoms,moderate
19,Levothyroxine,Calcium,moderate,Reduced thyroid hormone absorption,Calcium binds to levothyroxine in the gut preventing absorption,Take levothyroxine 4 hours apart from calcium supplements,high
20,Levothyroxine,Iron,moderate,Reduced thyroid hormone absorption,Iron binds to levothyroxine preventing absorption,Take levothyroxine 4 hours apart from iron supplements,high
21,Omeprazole,Clopidogrel,moderate,Reduced clopidogrel effectiveness increasing cardiac risk,Omeprazole inhibits CYP2C19 needed to activate clopidogrel,Use pantoprazole instead or H2 blocker if PPI needed,moderate
22,Amlodipine,Simvastatin,moderate,Increased statin levels and risk of muscle problems,Amlodipine inhibits CYP3A4 metabolism of simvastatin,Limit simvastatin to 20mg daily or use alternative statin,high
